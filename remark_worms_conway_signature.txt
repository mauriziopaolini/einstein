I find quite intriguing the possibility of an infinite sequence of
hats corresponding to the "same-color" arrays of hexagons in figure 2.2
of the arxiv paper.

Indeed, by looking at the subdivision rule based on the two H_7 and H_8
supertiles it turns out that there exists a complete alignment of such tiles in the
subdivided tiles running along a slightly decreasing alignment of small H_7 and
H_8 tiles after a number of subdivision steps starting from H_7 or H_8.

As a result, if we perform blow-ups about a point in that alignment we shall
obtain an infinite "worm".

This is *very* reminiscent of the bi-infinite worms that can be present in a
Penrose tiling (there are two of them in the cartwheel) and indeed we can find
a striking similarity by using the "Conway signature" construction associated to
a supertile of a complete tiling.

After a suitable numbering from 0 to 5 of the pieces of the subdivision of H_7
and from 0 to 6 of the pieces in the subdivision of H_8, precisely:

The single H_7 tile in both subdivision is numbered "0";
the rest are numbered 1 to 4 for the H_8 tiles adjacent to the H_7 (counter-clockwise);
the remaining H_8 tile in the subdivision of H_7 is numbered 5;
the corresponding H_8 tile in the subdivision of H_8 is also numbered 5;
the remaining tile in the subdivision of H_8 is numbered 6.

Then the Conway signature of a supertile in a tiling is an "infinite-to-the-left"
sequence of symbols in {0,...,6} where the pair "...06..." is forbidden since a tile
cannot have numbering 6 if resulting from a subdivision of an H_7.

This can be done for each supertile of any given tiling.

An infinite worm arises whenever such a signature (definitely) contains only
symbols in the smaller set {0,2,6} with the forbidden sequence "...06..."
